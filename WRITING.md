# Writing a lesson

## Where

`lessons/NN-part-name/NN-lesson-name.md`. The numbers give the order and the lesson's id
(`02-codec/03-...` is lesson 2.3). Each part folder has an `index.md` whose `# ` title is
the part's name and which links its lessons. `lessons/index.md` links every part and
lesson. `npm test` checks those links, and that each lesson ends with a link to the next.

## Shape

1. **What the Gray Paper says**: the rule, quoted or paraphrased, with its section
   (§11, *Refinement Context*; Appendix C). Check every quote against the 0.8.0 tex.
2. **The code**: tests first where it helps, then the code, each in a labelled snippet.
3. **Run**: the tests pass, the types check.
4. **lasair**, folded in `<details>`: the same rule in lasair's OCaml, quoted from the
   source (say when comments are trimmed), with a sentence on reading it.
5. A link to the next lesson.

Plain words, short sentences, no em-dashes. Explain why, not only what. Every claim about
lasair, the vectors or the Gray Paper is checked against the source before it is written.

## Labels

The line right above a code block, exactly one of:

```text
**New file** `src/x.ts`
**Add to** `src/x.ts`
**Replace in** `src/x.ts`
**Rewrite** `package.json`
**Run**
**Run, expect it to fail**
```

Paths are relative to `client/`. A Run block is ```` ```sh ````, runs in `client/`, and may
hold `# prints: text` or `# fails with: text` lines: the output must contain that text.

## Code style the tools rely on

- One import per line, at the top. A snippet's leading imports are merged into the
  file's (`tools/tangle.ts`).
- Top-level declarations start at column 0 with their comment directly above; their
  bodies are indented. **Replace in** swaps declarations by name; a type and a value of
  the same name are two declarations.
- No multi-line template literals that put text at column 0.
- Erasable TypeScript only (no `enum`, `namespace`, parameter properties): Node runs the
  files by stripping types.
- Field names as in the test vectors (`anchor_slot`).

## Before publishing a lesson

```sh
npm run verify        # every lesson, from an empty client
npm run check         # tools typecheck and tests, website build (dead links)
```

Then read the lesson rendered in VS Code's preview and on the website.
